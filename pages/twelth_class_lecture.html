                    <li>Pointer to an array
                        <ol>
                            <li>You can point to an array by pointing to the address of its first element. p = &a[0];</li>
                            <li>You can also point to an array with p = a;</li>
                            <li>When you add or subtract a value to a pointer, the address increases/decreases by <i>the integer times the size of the type the pointer points to</i>

                                    <li>In this way, adding 2 to a pointer which points to the first element in an array will now point to the third.</li>
                                </ol>

                    <li>Differences between an array and pointers
                        <ol>
                            <li>A compiler allocates space for the elements of the array.</li>
                            <li>For a pointer, only the pointer's physical space is allocated.</li>
                            <li>You can increment and decrement pointers directly, but you cannot do this with arrays</li>
                        </ol>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Strings
                <ol type = "A">
                    <li>A compiler stores place in memory equal to n+1. The n+1 character is a null character equal to ='\0'.</li>
                    <li>Strings can be subscripted with STRING_NAME[INDEX].</li>
                    <li>You can copy a string as an array.</li>
                    <li>Difference between character pointers and character arrays
                        <ol>
                            <li>char *p = "abcd" is equivalent to const char *p = "abcd". This creates a string "abcd" and points to the first element in it. The string is immutable.</li>
                            <li>char *p can be made to point somewhere else, but can't change the string directly.</li>
                            <li>char a[] = "abcd" permits editing.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Assigning character arrays
                        <ol>
                            <li>char a[5] = "ab" sets an array with two letters and 3 null values.
                                <ol type = "a" class = "lowerLetter">
                                    <li>Note that an array keeps printing until it hits a null value. If you remove the last value, it will print values outside of the array.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>char a[] = "abcd" creates an array exactly large enough to fit the string.</li>
                            <li>For using scanf("%s, str) you do not need to add an & (not scanf("%s",&str) for example).</li>
                            <li>
                                <ol type = "a" class = "lowerLetter">
                                    <li>scanf does not read the newline character, but fgets("%s",str1); will read it.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Careful not to compare strings directly because that will only compare the pointer. Also do not compare *a to *b because in an array it will only compare the first value.</li>
