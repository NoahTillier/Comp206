                    <li>Void can be used for the return type if you want nothing to be returned.</li>
                    <li>The return type cannot be an array</li>
                    <li>The function's name must be unique</li>
                    <li>Comma separated list of parameters (like in java)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Functions are called with FN_NAME(ARGUMENTS)</li>
            <li>All identifiers must be declared before they are used.
                <ol type = "A">
                    <li>A way to do this if you want your function to appear after the main method is to input <code>RETURN_TYPE FN_NAME(Parameters);</code> as a single line with a semicolon.</code></li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Arguments in C are passed by value. The variables in the body and declaration of the function are local to that function only.
                <ol type = "A">
                    <li>You can pass a pointer to a function to change the values. Passing by reference</li>
                    <li>Arrays as parameters are always passed by reference, which means they can be edited. Note however that you will be missing the size of the array.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Scope
                <ol type = "A">
                    <li>Variables can be declared outside of functions to have global scope</li>
                    <li>Returning an array/string created in a function would not work; that information would likely be overwritten.
                        <ol>
                            <li>You could instead pass a buffer to the function to store the array.</li>
                            <li>You could also instead make the string static (static char str[]) so that it does not get overwritten when the block terminates.</li>
                        </ol>
